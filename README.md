ðŸ”¹ Foundations of Networking & Web Architecture

IP Address â€“ What is an IP address and its types (IPv4 vs IPv6).
Client-Server Architecture â€“ How clients communicate with servers.
Protocol â€“ What is a protocol, and why do we need it?
HTTP & HTTPS â€“ How the web communicates securely.
DNS (Domain Name System) â€“ How domain names are resolved to IPs.

ðŸ”¹ Content Distribution & Caching
CDN (Content Delivery Network) â€“ How CDNs improve performance.
Caching â€“ Client-side, server-side, and distributed caching.
Database Indexing â€“ Speeding up database queries.

ðŸ”¹ Storage & Database Concepts
Databases (SQL vs NoSQL) â€“ Differences, when to use what.
KV Stores (Key-Value Stores) â€“ Redis, Memcached, DynamoDB, etc.
Partitioning â€“ Horizontal vs Vertical partitioning.
Sharding â€“ How to split databases for scale.
Replication â€“ Types of replication (Leader-Follower, Multi-Leader).
Denormalization â€“ Why and when to denormalize data.
Blob Storage â€“ Object storage like S3, Azure Blob.

ðŸ”¹ Communication in Distributed Systems
WebSockets â€“ Real-time bidirectional communication.
Webhooks â€“ Event-driven notifications.
Server-Sent Events (SSE) â€“ Streaming updates to the client.
Polling (Long & Short polling) â€“ Fetching updates periodically.
REST API vs GraphQL â€“ Differences, advantages, and trade-offs.
Synchronous vs Asynchronous Communication â€“ Between Microservices.
Message Queues (MQs) â€“ Kafka, RabbitMQ, SQS, etc.
Message Broker â€“ Decoupling microservices with brokers.

ðŸ”¹ Distributed System Concepts

Load Balancer â€“ How LB distributes traffic (Round Robin, Least Connections, etc.).
Proxy vs Reverse Proxy â€“ Role in security & performance.
Heartbeats in Distributed Systems â€“ Health checks in clusters.
Scaling (Vertical vs Horizontal) â€“ Auto-scaling strategies.
Rate Limiting â€“ Preventing abuse and ensuring fairness.
API Gateways â€“ Managing, securing, and monitoring APIs.
Idempotency â€“ Ensuring safe retries in APIs.
